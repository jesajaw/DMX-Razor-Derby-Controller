# DMX Derby Controller

A small Tkinter GUI to control a DMX derby/laser fixture over a USB-DMX adapter — one slider per channel, live plain-text readout of what each value actually does, and a blackout button.

## Features

- One slider per DMX channel (9-channel mode), each showing a description of the current value (e.g. `114 | Derby + Laser`) instead of a raw number.
- Non-blocking connect: opening the serial port runs in a background thread, so the GUI never freezes while connecting.
- Detects connection loss (e.g. adapter unplugged) during operation and reports it instead of failing silently.
- One-click blackout
- Three selectable color themes (purple / blue / black-white) via a config toggle at the top of the file.

## Todo
- Presets: load and safe .json for channel settins
- Music Mode: pyaudiowpatch -> FFT numpy -> Bass/Mid/Treble


## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ as installed through [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
- A USB-DMX adapter that shows up as a serial (COM) port

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jesajaw/DMX-Razor-Derby-Controller
cd DMX-Razor-Derby-Controller
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python DMX-Controller.py
```

1. Select the COM port your USB-DMX adapter is connected to.
2. Click **Connect**.
3. Move the sliders — changes are sent continuously (~33 Hz) while connected
4. **BLACKOUT** sets all channels to 0 immediately.
5. **Disconnect** stops sending and closes the port.

## Presets

Channel setups can be saved and reloaded as presets, stored as individual JSON files in the `presets/` folder (created automatically on first run).

- **Save As...** — stores the current slider values under a name you choose
- **Load** — applies the selected preset's values to all sliders (and live DMX output, if connected)
- **Delete** — removes the selected preset

Each preset is a plain JSON file (`presets/<name>.json`), so they can be copied, renamed, or shared individually:

```json
{
  "1": 44,
  "2": 180,
  "3": 216,
  "4": 0,
  "5": 128,
  "6": 60,
  "7": 0,
  "8": 254,
  "9": 127
}
```

## Limitations

- DMX512 is a unidirectional protocol: the controller has no way to confirm that a fixture is actually receiving data, only that the USB-DMX adapter itself is reachable over serial.
- Tested on Windows with a generic USB-DMX (FTDI-based) adapter.
